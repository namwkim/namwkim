Personal Webpage Driven by Data
=======

A data-driven website for an academic portfolio that includes publications, news, and travels, although it can be adapted for other personal portfolio websites. 

## How it works
The webpage is driven by personal data from ```.csv``` files including ```publications.csv```, ```news.csv```, ```travels.csv```, ```courses.csv```, located in [```/assets/files```](https://github.com/namwkim/namwkim.github.io/tree/master/assets/files). 

All the resources associated with the publications are located in the same folder and structured by publication types and paper titles. See the publication resources in [```/assets/files/publications```](https://github.com/namwkim/namwkim.github.io/tree/master/assets/files/publications).

The main Javascript file will then load the ```.csv``` files and populate the data into the webpage automatically. See the javascript file in [```/assets/js/index.js```](https://github.com/namwkim/namwkim.github.io/blob/master/assets/js/index.js). You should be able to see all the logic from there. 

If you are interested in using this website for your own personal webpage and need help or have questions, please let me know (email: namwkim85@gmail.com).
